# NethVoice Installation

NethVoice is a VoIP application that requires a specific installation on NethServer. This guide will walk you through the installation process.

:::tip
If you want a ready-to-use NethVoice installation, please consider:
- our **[NethVoice SaaS](saas.md#nethvoice-as-a-service)** service, which provides a fully managed NethVoice instance in the cloud
- a **[VoiceBox Appliance](voicebox.md)**, a hardware appliance with NethServer and NethVoice pre-installed
:::

## Module Installation {#module-installation}

1. **Access the Software Center** on your NethServer 8 system.
2. **Search for "NethVoice"** in the Software Center search bar.
3. **Click "Install"** next to NethVoice.
4. **Wait for installation** to complete (this may take a few minutes).

## First-time setup wizard {#setup-wizard}

Open the NethVoice application from the **Applications** page or from the **Application Drawer** in NethServer 8. A first-time configuration wizard will appear and guide you through:
- Configuring an account provider for NethVoice
- Installing and configuring the NethVoice Proxy
- Configuring the NethVoice application

### Account Provider

The first step of the setup wizard helps you configure the user domain used by NethVoice.

User domains store users and groups in an LDAP database. NethVoice requires a user domain to manage extensions, users, and authentication. 
NethServer 8 supports two types of LDAP account providers:

| Provider | Type | Best For | Features |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| **OpenLDAP (RFC2307)** | Internal | Unix/Linux clients, simple setup | Lightweight, easy configuration, smaller deployments, multiple instances per node |
| **Active Directory (Samba)** | Internal | Windows clients, SMB file sharing | Domain controller, Windows compatibility, higher complexity, one instance per node |
| **External LDAP** | External | Existing LDAP infrastructure | Connect to existing servers (Active Directory, OpenLDAP, etc.) |


:::info NethVoice Requirement
NethVoice requires at least one configured user domain. Choose **OpenLDAP (RFC2307)** for simpler deployments or **Active Directory** if you need Windows client support.
:::

#### Quick Setup: OpenLDAP (Recommended for NethVoice) {#quick-setup-openldap-recommended-for-nethvoice}

The setup wizard lets you quickly and easily install an OpenLDAP account provider. To configure it, you have to:

- **Enter domain name** (e.g., `nethvoice.local`) - this is a logical name, not DNS-related
- **Set OpenLDAP admin username and password**

For advanced scenarios (external LDAP, Active Directory, DNS setup, password policies, user management), see the [official NethServer 8 User Domains documentation](https://docs.nethserver.org/projects/ns8/en/latest/user_domains.htm).

Key topics in the official docs:
- **Active Directory Setup**: Complete domain controller configuration
- **External LDAP Connection**: Binding to existing LDAP servers
- **Password Policies**: Age, strength, and expiration settings
- **User Management Portal**: Self-service password changes
- **LDAP Provider Replicas**: Fault tolerance and redundancy
- **LDAP binding settings**: Connect external application to a local-running LDAP server

### NethVoice Proxy

The next step of the first setup wizard installs and configures the NethVoice Proxy.

NethVoice Proxy is a component that must be installed and configured before deploying NethVoice application instances. Even with a single NethVoice installation, the proxy is essential for proper network traffic management.

The proxy handles all external internet access and manages SIP/RTP traffic routing. It is required for:
- External access from the internet
- Traffic delegation to multiple NethVoice installations on the same node
- Managing SIP and RTP connections for all NethVoice instances
- SSL/TLS termination for internet-facing VoIP traffic

NethVoice Proxy is a standard NethServer 8 application: its settings can be reviewed and changed by accessing it from the **Application drawer** or from the **Applications** page.

#### Prerequisites

Before configuring NethVoice Proxy, ensure:

1. **DNS Records Created**: Create a DNS A/AAAA record for the proxy domain (e.g., `proxy.nethserver.org`) pointing to your public IP address
2. **Public IP Address**: Identify the public IPv4 or IPv6 address where the proxy will be accessible from the internet
3. **Network Interface**: Identify which network interface will handle VoIP traffic

The setup wizard detects automatically if there already is a proxy on the installation node of NethVoice and proposes to install it if needed. Then, to configure the NethVoice Proxy:

1. **Configure the Proxy domain** this is the public FQDN where the proxy will be reachable.
   Do not enter NethServer FQDN but use a dedicated one, like `proxy.nethserver.org`.
   This name will be used by external clients to reach your VoIP services, but
   it will not be used directly by final users.
2. **Enable Request Let's Encrypt certificate** checkbox if needed: a Let's Encrypt certificate will be requested for the proxy domain.
3. **Set the Network interface** that will handle VoIP traffic
4. **Configure Public IP address** if different from the interface IP

The above configuration will be the entrypoint for all external VoIP traffic.

Make sure that:
- the configured FQDN resolves correctly to the public IP address
- any DNS records are properly set up to point to the proxy

These requirements are critical to obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate for secure communications.

See [NethVoice Proxy Documentation](../advanced/nethvoice_proxy.md) for more info.

### NethVoice application

:::warning DNS configuration
To set up NethVoice, you need to have two dedicated virtual hosts:

- A **NethVoice base host** for the NethVoice administration interface, eg. `nethvoice.nethserver.org`
- A **NethVoice CTI base host** for the NethVoice CTI web application, eg. `cti.nethserver.org`

Before proceeding with the configuration, ensure that you have created the corresponding DNS records for these FQDNs in your DNS server.

If you plan to use a Let's Encrypt certificate as the default certificate, make sure you have the necessary public DNS records.
:::

In the last step of the setup wizard, you will be prompted to provide the following information:

- **NethVoice base host**: Enter a valid FQDN to access the application administration page; this is where you will manage NethVoice settings, e.g. `nethvoice.nethserver.org`.
- **NethVoice CTI base host**: Enter a valid FQDN for the NethVoice CTI web application, e.g. `cti.nethserver.org`.
- **Request Let's Encrypt certificate**: If enabled, a Let's Encrypt certificate will be requested for both the **NethVoice base host** and the **NethVoice CTI base host**.
- **Timezone**: Select the appropriate timezone for your NethVoice application; this is important for accurate call logging and scheduling.
- **Admin password to access user interface**: Sets the password for the NethVoice administration page.

### Next steps {#next-steps}

At the end of the first-time setup wizard, NethVoice will be accessible on the base host configured, e.g.:
```
https://nethvoice.nethserver.org
```

To access the NethVoice administration interface, use the following credentials:

- User: `admin`
- Password: The password you have chosen in the first-time setup wizard

After completing NethVoice configuration in the administration interface, users can access NethVoice CTI on the base host configured, e.g.:
```
https://cti.nethserver.org
```

## Module Configuration {#module-configuration}

The settings of the NethVoice module can be reviewed and changed by accessing the NethVoice module of NethServer 8. To do this:

- Access the NethServer cluster administration page.
- Open the NethVoice application from the **Application drawer** or from the **Applications** page.
- Go to the specific configuration page you want to modify.

On the **Settings** page you can review and change most of the configuration parameters:

- **NethVoice base host**: virtual host for the NethVoice administration interface.
- **NethVoice CTI base host**: virtual host for NethVoice CTI web application.
- **Request Let's Encrypt certificate**: if enabled, a Let's Encrypt certificate will be requested for both the **NethVoice base host** and the **NethVoice CTI base host**.
- **Account provider**: user domain used by NethVoice.
- **Timezone**: timezone for your NethVoice application, this is important for accurate call logging and scheduling.
- **Reports prefix**: telephone prefix number used in reports
- **New admin password for NethVoice**: define a new password for the `admin` user
