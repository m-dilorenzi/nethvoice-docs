# NethVoice Proxy

## Overview {#overview}

NethVoice Proxy is a critical component that handles all external VoIP traffic for NethVoice instances. It acts as a gateway for internet-based SIP and RTP connections, enabling secure external access to your telephony system.

:::info What is NethVoice Proxy?
NethVoice Proxy provides:
- **External VoIP Gateway**: Single entry point for all internet-based voice traffic
- **Traffic Routing**: Intelligent SIP/RTP traffic delegation to multiple NethVoice installations on the same node
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Secure encrypted connections for external VoIP traffic
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming calls across multiple NethVoice instances
- **NAT Traversal**: Handles Network Address Translation for remote and mobile users

**Important**: NethVoice Proxy is required for every NethVoice deployment, even with a single instance. It manages external internet access and must be installed and configured before deploying any NethVoice instances.
:::

## Architecture {#architecture}

NethVoice Proxy module is built on two main open-source components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **[Kamailio](https://www.kamailio.org)** | SIP proxy server for managing all SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) connections |
| **[RTP Engine](https://github.com/sipwise/rtpengine/)** | RTP proxy for managing RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) connections |

These components work together to manage all incoming and outgoing SIP and RTP connections between your NethVoice instances and external VoIP networks (internet, trunks, remote offices, mobile users).

## Role in NethVoice Deployments {#role-in-nethvoice-deployments}

### Single Instance Deployment {#single-instance-deployment}

Even with a single NethVoice installation, NethVoice Proxy is essential:
- Acts as the external interface for internet-based VoIP traffic
- Handles SSL/TLS encryption for remote users
- Manages NAT traversal for mobile and remote connections
- Provides a single domain for external users to reach your PBX

### Multi-Instance Deployment {#multi-instance-deployment}

With multiple NethVoice instances on the same node, NethVoice Proxy provides:
- **Single External Entry Point**: External callers use one FQDN (the proxy domain)
- **Traffic Routing**: Proxy intelligently routes calls to the appropriate NethVoice instance
- **Load Distribution**: Distributes calls across multiple instances
- **Shared SSL Certificates**: Manages external security for all instances
- **Centralized Trunk Management**: External trunks can be shared or routed to specific instances

:::example Multi-Instance Architecture
```
Internet/External Trunks
        ↓
   NethVoice Proxy
   (proxy.domain.com)
    ↙        ↓        ↘
Instance 1  Instance 2  Instance 3
(tenant A) (tenant B)  (tenant C)
```

In this scenario:
- All external traffic arrives at the proxy
- Proxy routes calls to the appropriate NethVoice instance based on routing rules
- Each instance operates independently while sharing external access

## Installation {#installation}

### Recommended Installation: {#installation-steps}

NethVoice proxy is installed as part of the NethVoice module setup wizard. See [NethVoice Installation](../install/nethvoice_install.md) for the complete installation sequence.

### Manual Installation (not recommended):

:::note
You can install only one NethVoice Proxy per node from the Software Center.
:::

NethVoice Proxy must be installed **before** deploying any NethVoice instances.

1. **Open NethServer Management Interface**
2. **Navigate to Software Center**
3. **Search for "NethVoice Proxy"**
4. **Click "Install"** and wait for installation to complete
5. **Proceed to configuration** (see section below)

## Configuration {#configuration}

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before configuring NethVoice Proxy, ensure:

1. **DNS Records Created**: Create a DNS A/AAAA record for the proxy domain (e.g., `proxy.nethserver.org`) pointing to your public IP address
2. **Public IP Address**: Identify the public IPv4 or IPv6 address where the proxy will be accessible from the internet
3. **Network Interface**: Identify which network interface will handle VoIP traffic

### Configuration Steps {#configuration-steps}

NethVoice Proxy is usually configured during the setup wizard of a NethVoice module (see [NethVoice Installation](../install/nethvoice_install.md) for the complete installation sequence). To review or modify the proxy configuration:

1. **Access the proxy configuration page** in the NethServer management interface
2. **Enter the Proxy Domain**: Set a valid FQDN (e.g., `proxy.nethserver.org`)
   - This domain must have a valid DNS A/AAAA record pointing to your public IP
   - External VoIP devices and remote offices will use this domain to reach your system
3. **Request SSL Certificate**:
   - Enable Let's Encrypt to automatically manage SSL certificates for the proxy domain
   - This requires the DNS record to be publicly resolvable
4. **Select Network Interface**: Choose the network interface that will handle VoIP traffic from the dropdown menu
   - This is typically the interface connected to your WAN/Internet
5. **Configure Public IP Address**: 
   - Enter the public IPv4 or IPv6 address if different from the interface IP
   - This is necessary if your node is behind a router/NAT
   - Leave blank if the interface has a direct public IP address

### Configuration Example {#configuration-example}

**Scenario**: Single node with private network interface, public IP behind NAT

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Proxy Domain | `proxy.example.com` | Public FQDN, DNS record created |
| Network Interface | `eth0` (WAN interface) | Private IP: 192.168.1.10 |
| Public IP Address | `203.0.113.45` | Public routable IP address |
| Let's Encrypt | Enabled | Automatic certificate for `proxy.example.com` |

**Result**: External devices connect to `proxy.example.com` (203.0.113.45), traffic routes internally to 192.168.1.10

### Special Cases {#special-cases}

#### Local Network Only (No Internet Access) {#local-network-only-no-internet-access}

If the proxy is only accessible within a local network and not from the internet:

```
Proxy Domain: proxy.internal.local
Network Interface: eth0 (Private network)
Public IP Address: <blank> or internal IP (192.168.1.10)
Let's Encrypt: Disabled
```

Use the private IP address that devices on your local network use to reach the proxy.

#### Multiple External IPs {#multiple-external-ips}

If your node has multiple public IP addresses, configure the proxy with the specific public IP you want for VoIP traffic:

1. Set the Network Interface to the interface receiving traffic
2. Enter the specific public IP in the "Public IP Address" field
3. Ensure DNS records point to this IP address

The proxy acts as a gateway between external VoIP traffic and internal NethVoice instances.
